Welcome to my first ever blog post. Well, it is really the 3rd or 4th if you take a look at my commit history...but this is the first official one!

I have wanted to write a blog for years, but have never had the courage to put myself out there for wider criticism. Eventually, I thought "what do I have to lose?"

So here we are today. I have no idea how long I will keep this up or how good the quality will be, but I am practicing what I preach.

*"Taking action, even if imperfect, is far more valuable than inaction."*


With that being said, I have exposed many of my once private repositories. You can find them [here](https://blog.varmack.com/repositories).

Phew, that was a lot to do and that wraps up this first post. I'll be back with more about my dev containers project soon!
